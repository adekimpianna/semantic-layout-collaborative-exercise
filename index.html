    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>Our team is called SkyBlue. From left to the right, alphabetically: Boam, Feruz, Harun, Miroslav, Murielle and Yana.
      <br> We are six and we come from different countries, but we do have one thing in common: learning how to code at Hack Your Future.
      <br> Here we learn programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on. And here, our team is mentored by Stephane (not on the photo above).
      <br> At this moment, we have to study online via ZOOM due to Corona Crisis.
